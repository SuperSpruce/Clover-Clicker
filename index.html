		11-10-2019, v0.4.0 beta: Added the 4-leaf Clover, and the first upgrade (Bigger Leaves 1) <br>
		11-11-2019, v0.4.1 beta: Now you can see your flowers, the "Click for a flower!" button, your flowers per second, and your flowers per click in every tab. <br>
		11-22-2019, v0.4.2 beta: Huge thanks to Reinhardt for figuring out how to make upgrades that not only function, but are easy to make and look good. <br>
		11-22-2019, v0.4.3 beta: Added the first 5 upgrades (all 4 bigger leaves and triplet leaves) <br>
		11-23-2019, v0.4.4 beta: Added 8 more upgrades. <br>
		11-23-2019, v0.4.5 beta: Fixed the bug where you load the game and your clovers read as 0 instead of the actual amount and the costs are displayed as their default value. <br>
		11-23-2019, v0.4.6 beta: Fixed a bug where "Triplet Leaves" only multiplied 3-leaf clover production by 2 instead of 3. <br>
		11-24-2019, v0.4.7 beta: Added this changelog. <br>
		11-25-2019, v0.4.8 beta: Numbers over 1 million are now formatted in scientific notation. <br>
		12-2-2019,  v0.4.9 beta: Buttons for clovers are now colored to show if they are buyable of not.<br>
		12-9-2019, v0.4.10 beta: Upgrade costs now display in scientific notation; each clover's flowers per second per clover display now accounts for upgrades.<br>
		12-9-2019, v0.4.11 beta: There is now a display of how many flowers per second each type of clover is producing, along with some UI display changes to the clovers.<br>
		12-13-2019, v0.4.12 beta: Fixed a bug where the 4-leaf clover cost wasn't formatted as scientific notation; attempted to fix a bug where you couldn't buy an upgrade before you hard resetted by forcing hard reset on a save loaded with no flowers and no clovers.<br>
